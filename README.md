# Building Archetype Model Database (BAM-DB)

This repostitory documents a set of archetype building desings, designed to modern seismic U.S. codes. Each design contains an [OpenSees](https://opensees.berkeley.edu/) model for assessing structural performance and [FEMA P-58](https://femap58.atcouncil.org/) and [ATC-138](https://www.atcouncil.org/atc-138) models for assessing building loss and downtime risk. The archetypes are designed for a general high seismicity, Dmax, site with a soil class of C and follow the [ASCE/SEI 7-16](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/asce-7) design provision. The archetype set includes reference models designed to meet minimum base shear and drift requirements as well as enhanced designs that are designed for up to 50% higher strengths and 1% drift limits. Basic properties of each model are contained within the "models.csv" file, with detialed design, model, and response data in subsequent subfolders.
